# Find Co-working Spaces in Singapore
## Project Summary

### **Background**
Co-working workplaces are becoming increasingly popular as the demand for flexible working arrangements increases, especially since many workers become distracted by the constant work-from-home routine due to the COVID pandemic. Workers who were driven to work from home since the pandemic are experiencing burn-out and becoming less productive due to the blurring of work life boundaries. While cafes can also be a great alternative for remote working and hotdesking, there is no guarantee of good wi-fi, table space or or other necessities required to fufill basic working needs.

### **Target Users**
Target users are remote workers, freelancers, entrepreneurs who are looking for an alternative to working at home or would like a conducive and productive working environment.

### **Organisation Goals**
A website with an interactive map that allows target users to search for their ideal Co-working spaces or offices in Singapore that meets their working or business needs.

### **User Goals**
Remote workers can easily search for available co-working spaces in Singapore. As work-life balance is also an important aspect of a healthy working environment, the website also allows users to look for nearby gyms and supermarkets to fufill their fitness or lifestyle needs after working hours. 

### **Project Justification**
Remote working and hotdesking are proving to be the new normal in the future of work, and co-working spaces are the next best solution away from a traditional office environment. The website would be a useful tool to help target users to search and discover working spaces all around Singapore.
