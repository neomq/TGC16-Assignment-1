# **Discover Co-working Spaces in Singapore**

<br />

## 1. Project Summary

### **Background**
Co-working workplaces are becoming increasingly popular as the demand for flexible working arrangements increases, especially since many workers become distracted by the constant work-from-home routine due to the COVID pandemic. Workers who were driven to work from home since the pandemic are experiencing burn-out and becoming less productive due to the blurring of work life boundaries. While cafes can also be a great alternative for remote working and hotdesking, there is no guarantee of good wi-fi, table space or or other necessities required to fufill basic working needs.

### **Organisation Goals**
A website with an interactive map that allows target users to search for their ideal Co-working spaces or offices in Singapore that meets their working or business needs.

### **User Goals**
Remote workers can easily search for available co-working spaces in Singapore. As work-life balance is also an important aspect of a healthy working environment, the website also allows users to look for nearby gyms and supermarkets to fufill their fitness or lifestyle needs after working hours. 

### **Project Justification**
Remote working and hotdesking are proving to be the new normal in the future of work, and co-working spaces are the next best solution away from a traditional office environment. The website would be a useful tool to help target users to search and discover working spaces all around Singapore.

### **5 Planes of UI/UX**
#### 1. Strategy
1. **Target Users**: Remote workers, freelancers, entrepreneurs who are looking for an alternative to working at home or would like a conducive and productive working environment.
2. **Users Needs**: User needs to easily and conviently search for workspaces in Singapore that meets their day to day working or business needs.
3. **Site Objective**: To suggest or help target users search for their ideal workspaces by giving an overview of the different locations of co-working spaces in singapore via an interactive map, or help users to search for available co-working spaces around an area.

### 2. Scope
**Functional Requirements:**
- Allows users to perform basic search using a search bar. Users are able to search by location and keyword.
- An interactive map that displays the location of all the search results and users are able to toggle between different map layers showing locations of nearby amenities.
- An informative display of search results that provides the address, opening hours and link to website for more information.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Mobile responsiveness: to cater to users on the go who are using the app on their mobile devices.
- Usability: Easy to perform the search and view search results.

### 3. Structure
**Interaction Design:**
1. Discoverability & Accessibility:
- Search bar and search button is prominently displayed. Size of the search button is large to allow a larger clickable area for ease of clicking.
- Search bar is also accessible on both the home page and on the map.
- Icons on map buttons are labelled to give clarity to the button function.
2. Consistency:
- Consistent font styles, background and colours are used throughout to eliminate confusion of the user.
- Graphic elements are placed at commonly used locations on the web page that are familiar to the user (i.e. logo on the top left and search bar on top)
3. Learnability:
- User interface is intuitive and easy to use
4. Error Prevention & Recovery
- Dsiplay an error message to the user when user performs an invalid search. A simple instruction is given to help the user perform a valid search.

**Information Architecture**
1. A linear web structure to optimise user-friendliness.

### 4. Skeleton
**Interface Design:**
Below are some of the factors that have been considered when designing the user interface:
1. Mobile friendliness
- UI elements and text are able to fit on different screen sizes
2. Contrast
- Contrast is applied to important text (i.e. Title of search result), icons and search button as best as possible to draw users attention
3. Familiarity
- UI elements (i.e. search box, search button, close button, links etc.) are intuitive and performs the expected behaviour that users have been accustomed to.
4. Font and colour weight
- To establish visual hierarchy, all headings have bolder font weight than body text. Important elements such as the search button have a stronger colour. Supporting information (i.e. opening hours, address) have a lighter font weight.
5. Typography
- Only one typeface is used (default typeface of bootstrap)
